00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:17,489
Hi, everybody. Um I wanna thank TLT for the invitation to present.

1
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,899
Um And for all of you to who,

2
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:25,030
who shared your time to come here so that I can tell you about my course.

3
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:26,799
All right, we'll start.

4
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,939
So just two weeks ago

5
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,889
um at the Goldman Sachs talks, Ceo Peter Fagi

6
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:56,200
from the

7
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,939
Ann

8
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,939
Anna Freud

9
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,150
um Center

10
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:04,610
commented that young people are becoming less and less

11
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,180
happy as a result of their screen time.

12
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,180
Why? Because of the lack of human interaction,

13
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,059
I'm here to tell you that it depends on how you think about it

14
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,480
and how you use it.

15
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,040
We are tasked to create a collaborative learning community

16
00:01:21,339 --> 00:01:22,199
online.

17
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:24,830
That's what the le program does that we

18
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:28,319
have a seminar style learning community education,

19
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:30,860
the College of Fine Arts, however,

20
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:37,599
um was being left out of our ability to deliver that service. Why?

21
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,940
Because those students have such intense face to face daily schedules that

22
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:45,959
they cannot get their requirements done with a face to face course.

23
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,779
So they asked us specifically to create

24
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,300
an online course for those particular students.

25
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:57,800
But the challenge was to create an online course that enables community.

26
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,480
So that is what we did.

27
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,500
Imagine

28
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,529
creating an art history course with the

29
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,169
ad a requirements of presenting this painting,

30
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:08,839
Vincent Van

31
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,639
Gogh's Starry Night

32
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:14,600
to a, a legally blind student. Well, I've had to do that

33
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,529
and I took that same approach that I took with that student and making sure that

34
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:24,210
he got the same learning outcomes that everyone else did in my class to this project

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,179
to give the same learning outcomes that we get in a face to face seminar

36
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,630
in an online environment.

37
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:39,839
And I thought about it this way and this is where Chris or my designer um

38
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:43,380
and I met had a meeting of the minds. We both have mbas

39
00:02:43,809 --> 00:02:48,570
and we thought about this as the goal determines your means of delivery.

40
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,830
So to create the highest quality educational experience

41
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,229
for our online learning community of freshmen,

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,509
fine art students,

43
00:02:56,714 --> 00:03:00,854
we harnessed the capabilities of canvas that are typically

44
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:05,365
um well created and made for a lecture style course.

45
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:10,375
Um And we adapted it to a seminar style by pushing beyond

46
00:03:10,384 --> 00:03:14,065
the limits of canvas and bringing in new technologies to do that.

47
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,585
So then the next set of slides I want to show you what we did.

48
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,470
Um First let me tell you what the preparation took. And this took a lot of work.

49
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:28,860
I attended the TLT Faculty boot camp, which I would highly recommend to anybody.

50
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,820
I used the alignment grid that was created by TLT

51
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,190
um to create a very tightly integrated

52
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,300
curriculum which is absolutely essential if you're

53
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:40,990
going to innovate on top of a really solid foundation for your course.

54
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,929
I also thanks to um the le program,

55
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,929
they funded my ability to attend an

56
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,190
international conference on elearning and innovative pedagogy.

57
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,490
So I could see what cutting edge looked like.

58
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,399
And then Chris and I both um shared best practices. We researched a lot

59
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,470
and then I created prototypes that I tested

60
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,089
out on students and peer advisors in advance

61
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:07,190
uh developed strong collaboration with my course designer.

62
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:11,559
And then also um the video support that I was offered at TLT.

63
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,320
And then thanks to Corey Stokes who made this all possible and set the

64
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:20,309
bar high by giving me the challenge of Make Me a showcase course.

65
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,670
Um So that's what we, we worked really hard and we wrote your Fleas, Corey.

66
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,290
Um One of the things that we

67
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:31,670
uh incorporated were evocative visuals absolutely essential.

68
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:33,950
If you're going to capture the attention of fine art students,

69
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,470
they are used to aesthetics.

70
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,829
Um And one of the things and one of the challenges of

71
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:43,339
online education is getting a student motivated enough to turn on that computer

72
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:46,239
and get connected just to even start.

73
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,790
So um uh Chris will be showing you a little bit more about what that means.

74
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,739
If you look just here on this slide,

75
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,660
the black arrows are indicating what canvas provides.

76
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,959
I found that very limiting.

77
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,980
It's so structured it's so linear, it's boring and it's formal,

78
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:03,619
especially for a fine art student.

79
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,315
So we added in visual and I said, I don't want just something attractive.

80
00:05:07,345 --> 00:05:09,165
It's got to move and it's got to move.

81
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:11,375
Not in a repetitive worrying way,

82
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:15,535
but it's got to be engaging and it has to give those students information

83
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:17,105
at a glance,

84
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:19,334
what is going to happen in the module that

85
00:05:19,345 --> 00:05:21,605
they're going to study so that they already have

86
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:24,355
an end to that material and they're already engaged

87
00:05:24,364 --> 00:05:27,734
just from because an image is worth 1000 words.

88
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:31,274
And then we've also added in checklist and introductory videos.

89
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:34,165
So they know what they have to do and they know why.

90
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,720
Secondly, the content matrix was entirely student

91
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:39,190
focused.

92
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,309
It's not just about content but about who those students

93
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,190
are as learners and how we can engage them better.

94
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:49,700
So I created an innovative um uh curriculum just specifically for them, the

95
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:54,220
they are gaining um social science, general education credit.

96
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:59,109
But I um made sure to show how the application

97
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:02,709
of each of those social sciences to the fine arts,

98
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:07,750
but using real world examples that are current so that the students would see the

99
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,839
relevance of what they're learning and be familiar with it um through the fine arts,

100
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,440
through that, through that lens,

101
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,839
uh the in the curriculum is integrated with very clear objectives,

102
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,250
progressive difficulty and complexity as you

103
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,200
move through the course and then latter

104
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:26,339
social interactions very important in building

105
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,690
communities starting with just simple introductions.

106
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,890
But by the time they're done,

107
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:35,309
there are engaged in very intense teamwork and community um activities.

108
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,559
We also created custom features just specifically for this course to try

109
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,410
to emulate what it's like to be in my face to face.

110
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,920
Course, one of the things I do with freshmen,

111
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,320
um they are not practiced readers yet.

112
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:53,130
I want I guide them through an article that's best practices about what

113
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:59,329
a real social science research um article looks like the components of that.

114
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:06,589
So we created an annotated version with video inserts of me inside the article

115
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,299
that guide them through so that they know how to read that article.

116
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,429
Uh In addition to our checklist also pro project charts,

117
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,010
so they know what they have to do,

118
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,929
how much they've already accomplished and where they're headed

119
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,209
now they can manage their time more easily,

120
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,589
then how to tutorials with um

121
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:25,369
view code.

122
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:27,429
Sure,

123
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,459
since I've been tracking it

124
00:07:31,989 --> 00:07:32,929
working full time

125
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:33,779
G

126
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:41,489
and what it does is it shows a, a video clip that moves um just in a subtle motion

127
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,600
and what this uh it's actually kind of an old technology,

128
00:07:44,609 --> 00:07:48,429
but we used it to affect here in the class because canvas actually deals with, with,

129
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,450
with this just fine.

130
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:51,950
And what this does is for the students.

131
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,190
It gives them a signpost,

132
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,250
it gives them an idea of what is the information

133
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,989
they're going to be going over in this course.

134
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,559
And so, and like you said,

135
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,380
the aesthetics were very important to the students that come in through this class.

136
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:01,579
And

137
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,000
uh so we've had a lot of really good feedback on this. This is kind of a neat

138
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,380
um uh this video is from a set of people who still make handmade globes.

139
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:15,820
Um And then you also mentioned the learning tree exercise. There is a tool called um

140
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:16,149
uh

141
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:16,920
CALC

142
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:17,709
Js.

143
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,660
So it's a javascript type uh calculator where we created this slider

144
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,700
where students could try to figure out how um their pay,

145
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:28,929
how a student would pay for college.

146
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,380
So you figure out your um tuition costs your hourly

147
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,190
wage and whatnot and tax rate and all that.

148
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,200
And it all comes up in here real time.

149
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:40,270
This is a, a tool that's outside of canvas, like I said,

150
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,530
but it embeds into canvas and you can uh the students

151
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,330
did this exercise as a simulation and then they

152
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,169
would come in and um do a reflection about

153
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:53,010
how difficult it was to try to figure out how to pay for uh pay for college.

154
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:55,179
And then uh

155
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,369
this is slack that we were talking about.

156
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,369
Once again, this is uh like you were saying, this is not an academic tool.

157
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,919
This is very popular in uh start ups, actually seven or $8 billion company now.

158
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:12,609
Um And uh we've been very happy with the um

159
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,929
a lot of people who use the the boards that automatically grade,

160
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,900
this doesn't automatically grade but you can, when you post into Slack,

161
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:22,659
you can get a URL for your post,

162
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:25,359
which is something that you can take back and turn into canvas.

163
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:25,900
And then

164
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
when Dr Brown was doing her grading,

165
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,260
she could click on that link and go straight to what the students wanted to highlight

166
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,630
as their

167
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,539
uh as the answer for their assignment.

168
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,030
What I thought was really cool is when we started looking through this,

169
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,729
the branches of conversation that just came off of all

170
00:09:40,739 --> 00:09:42,500
of the things that the students were talking about.

171
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,960
I mean, there is a linear

172
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:48,030
to it just for order of conversation of who's talking and whatnot.

173
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,859
But for the idea of getting in the students into another place to, to talk,

174
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:55,169
this doesn't end up with the discussion board being,

175
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,690
you know, the question being

176
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,250
uh two plus two and then someone responds,

177
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,599
I really like how you added the two to the two

178
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:04,010
and got four great job.

179
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,119
So we felt like this worked out really well.

180
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,330
And it also um worked with the aesthetics again because people could post videos,

181
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,210
pictures and they've been doing that um based on the subjects that

182
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:16,489
you've been giving on and ones that they've been doing themselves.

183
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:16,770
So

184
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,280
once again, what was really rewarding on this project was that

185
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,429
uh Doctor Brown would come and she'd have

186
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,539
an idea of something she wanted to accomplish.

187
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:29,059
And we had uh really kind of no idea where we were gonna end up with a solution.

188
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,440
But she was really open to looking at new ideas and tools and

189
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,969
uh um working with things that weren't the perfect solution,

190
00:10:36,979 --> 00:10:38,539
they were something that came in

191
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:40,309
and she had to work with.

192
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,099
And I think that was a testament to you working with

193
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,340
the innovative tools here and for the benefit of the students.

194
00:10:45,349 --> 00:10:45,580
So

195
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,260
thank you very much.
